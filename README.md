## Installation
Simply git clone this repo. You will need Node JS, as well as a few dependencies such as "console.table", "inquirer", and "mysql2". In addition to that you will need MySQL. Begin by running MySQL and sourcing the schema.sql file to generate the database. Afterwards, source the seeds.sql file to populate these tables. From there you have a mockup of a pretend database to see how it functions.

## Usage
Click [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FnJnIpauOPIwmXO6qz_oAy0X9zo0JE9x/view?usp=sharing) to see a video walkthrough about the project. Since it's a bit longer I recorded my voice to make it easier to follow what I'm doing at a given point.

Once your database is created, run "npm start" in your terminal. It will give you various prompts, and when you're done you can select "Exit" to close the database. While in the program though, the "View" options lets you see the various tables. To make your own additions or changes, simply select the other prompts and answer their requests. When you've made your changes, you can check to confirm these by going back to the database "View" options.
